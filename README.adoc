= Keytab generator

This Python module is an alternative to `ktutil` for creating a Kerberos keytab.

Similar to newer versions of `ktutil`, it allows for the overriding of the default salt used for encryption of AES keys.

== The salt issue

AES keys stored in the keytab are encrypted using a salt that _typically_ derived from the principal name. By default, the salt is formed by concatenating the REALM with the principal short name.

This works well for MIT KDCs.

For Active Directory (AD) KDCs, the user's login name (`samAccountName`) and principal name (`userPrincipalName`) can sometimes differ.
For example, a username could have a login name `jdoe` and a principal name of `jane.doe@EXAMPLE.COM` or `JDoe@EXAMPLE.COM`.
In this case, when encrypting data, AD will use `EXAMPLE.COMjane.doe` or `EXAMPLE.COMJDoe`, respectively, as the salt and the keytab salt must match it for it to work, otherwise the keytab authentication will fail with a "pre-authentication failure".

For FreeIPA, the salt is a random string. To successfully create a keytab you have to always specify the correct salt.

`ktutil` versions 1.16 and above added a `-s` option to the `addent` command that allows you to specify a custom salt for the key.
The `krb5-workstation` package on Centos 8 machines come with this features but Centos 7 still has version 1.15 of that package, which doesn't allow for salt specification.

This python module works well in both environments and can replace `ktutil` for creating a keytab correctly.

== Validating keytabs and automatically fixing salt issues

If `kinit` is available on the system and `--validate` is specified, the generated keytab will be validated.
If the validation fails and an alternative salt is reported in the validation process the keytab will be re-generated and re-validated using the reported salt. This behaviour can be suppressed with `--no-alternative-salt`.

== Using in the command line

Can be used as a standalone file:
[source,shell]
----
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
python keytab.py --help
----

Or installed with pip and imported in python:
[source,shell]
----
pip install git+https://github.com/samueljamesbader/keytab-creator.git
python -c "import keytab; keytab.create_keytab('krb5.keytab','principal@DOMAIN','password')"
